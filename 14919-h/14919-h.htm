        West-End.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Algy.</i> Waiter! bring me a brandy-and-soda. Don't
        feel up to the average to-day.</p>

        <p><i>Hughie.</i> Late last night?</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> Yes. Went to Mrs. CRAMMERLY's Dance,
        Prince's Gate. Goodness knows <i>why</i> I went! I don't
        think they'll get me there again in a hurry.</p>

        <p><i>Charlie</i> (<i>waking up from arm-chair</i>). Were
        <i>you</i> a victim too? I didn't see you there!</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> No. Because I probably left before you
        arrived. I had had enough of it in an hour, and came on
        here to supper; not before I had nearly poisoned myself
        with a concoction that old CRAMMERLY was asserting loudly,
        was an "'80 wine."</p>

        <p><i>Charlie</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Ah! my dear friend,
        <i>I</i> had been there before, and knew the ropes. Took
        pretty good care to steer clear of the wine, and got a chap
        to give me a whiskey-and-soda.</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited Member.</i> May I ask where was this
        charming Party?</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> At the CRAMMERLY's, Prince's Gate. Colonel
        CRAMMERLY.</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> Colonel CRAMMERLY! Let's see, was he
        an old Crimea man?</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> <i>No</i>!&mdash;He <i>was</i> Colonel in
        the Bounders Green Volunteers. (<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)
        You know "CRAMMERLY's Starch"&mdash;made a fortune out of
        it.</p>

        <p><i>Charlie.</i> He must have spent a bit of it last
        night. They say the flowers alone cost over a thousand
        pounds.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Enter</i> Captain O.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Captain O.</i> Talking about the Colonel CRAMMERLY
        Party, eh? (<i>To</i> Uninvited M.) Were you there?</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> (<i>very satirically</i>). Oh, dear
        no! I fear I'm not smart enough to warrant my admittance
        into that <i>charmed</i> and <i>select</i> circle.
        [<i>Roars of laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> By Jove, you were well out of it.
        (<i>Addressing the Club generally.</i>) Did&mdash;you ever
        see such&mdash;eh?</p>

        <p><i>Charlie.</i> I want to know where the deuce they get
        their men from.</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> I fancy they discover them in the City.</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> <i>I</i> never met&mdash;such shocking
        people before.</p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> Too dreadful for words. I could only
        conclude they must have been relations. [<i>Roars of
        laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> By the way, did you notice that there was a
        "bounder" who was reversing?</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> (<i>with great indignation</i>).
        No!!!</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> I tell you it's a positive fact&mdash;I
        know it to my cost; for I was dancing with that youngest
        daughter, you know&mdash;the one who has the fluffy fringe
        over her forehead&mdash;and the brute bounced against us,
        and sent us flying. Never even apologised. If I could have
        got him outside, I declare I would have given him a deuced
        good hiding. A man like that ought to be kicked.</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> Were the women any better?</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> Well, if you call Mrs. DASH any better!</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> (<i>with tragic intensity</i>). You
        <i>don't</i> mean to say <i>she</i> was there!</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> I <i>do</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> But do you mean to say that Mrs.
        CRAMMERLY has heard&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> No. She's deaf. [<i>Laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> Well, you <i>do</i> surprise me!
        (<i>After a long pause.</i>) Any other shining lights of
        London Society?</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> No&mdash;except that fearful Mrs. JUSSOPH
        and her daughters, who honoured me with an invitation to
        their afternoon party at their suburban residence at
        <i>West Kensington</i>. I don't know whether you regard
        them as an illumination. [<i>Roars of laughter.</i></p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> (<i>triumphantly.</i>) Good
        gracious! Then there was positively no one there that one
        knows.</p>

        <p><i>Algy</i> (<i>thinking he has said something
        original</i>). No one, that one <i>wants</i> to know.</p>

        <p><i>Uninvited M.</i> I suppose the whole thing was done
        for an advertisement&mdash;?</p>

        <p><i>Algy.</i> Possibly. Anyhow, once bitten, twice shy.
        They won't get <i>me</i> inside their stuccoed palace
        again.</p>

        <p><i>Chorus of Those who were at the Party.</i> Same here!
        [<i>Pause.</i></p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> (<i>lighting cigar by candle</i>). By
        the way, JACK, did old CRAM. ask you to Scotland for the
        12th?</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> Yes.</p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> So he did me. Shall you go?</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> It depends&mdash;I think so&mdash;if I
        don't get anything better. I'm told it's a wonderful shoot.
        They pulled down over a thousand birds the first day, last
        year.</p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> Does old CRAMMERLY shoot?</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> Oh dear no! He's as blind as a bat. He only
        rents it for his friends.</p>

        <p><i>Capt. O.</i> (<i>greatly relieved</i>). That's good
        news, for he's a terrible bore. He'd be a shocking nuisance
        on the Moors. I must say, I can't stand <i>him</i> at any
        price.</p>

        <p><i>Jack.</i> No, nor any of the family, for the matter
        of that. Well, ta, ta! Perhaps we shall meet there. I'm off
        to the Empire, to join some friends who've got a box.</p>

    <p>"PERFIDIOUS ALBION" AGAIN.&mdash;Lieutenant MIZON, with his
    grievances against the British Niger Company, was <i>fêted</i>
    last week in Paris. To inform Frenchmen that the British
    Company in question is not so <i>niger</i> as it has been
    painted would be useless at the present moment, when Frenchmen
    are still loud in their applause of the speech made by the

            <p>Brave Sir CARLOS EUAN-SMITHEZ! basely have they
            borne thee down;</p>

            <p>Thousands, thirty, would they tip thee as a churl
            they'd tip a crown?</p>

            <p>Thou at home hadst shown that Sultan with emphatic
            toe the door;</p>

            <p>In Morocco thou didst coolly turn thy back upon the
            Moor.</p>

            MAHOUND.</p>

            <p>Full eight weeks' negociations smoothed that
            Treaty's parlous way;</p>

            <p>On the fifth July the Sultan swore it should be

    <h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Last Nights of the
    Season.</i>&mdash;<i>Monday.</i>&mdash;"By General Desire," the
    Second and Third Acts of DE LARA-Boom-de-ay's Opera, called
    <i>La Luce dell' Asia</i>, followed by <i>Cavalleria
    Rusticana</i>. Was "by general desire" applied to the entire
    programme, or only to its first part? Well, we may take for
    granted that everyone wanted to hear and see again&mdash;but
    especially to hear&mdash;the <i>Cavalleria</i>. So the "special
    desire" must apply to <i>La Luce</i> solely and only. If so,
    then from this wording we gather that the general and
    uncontrollable desire to hear the Second and Third Acts of DE
    LA-RA-Boom's Opera did not extend to its Prologue, First Act,
    Fourth Act (if any), and Epilogue. But is it complimentary to a
    Composer to express a general wish to hear only certain
    portions of his work, implying thereby that the generally
    un-expressed desire is rather against than for re-hearing the
    other portions? All the same Sir COVENT GARDENIUS exercises a
    <i>sound</i> discretion in thus dealing with this particular
    Opera.</p>

    <p>And he did so, by saying in the programme "&#9758; In
    consequence of its Great Success and by general desire." Ha!
    ha! look at the hand, with index-finger outstretched! By this
    sign, Sir DRURIOLANUS would have us to understand that "this
    Opera was not one which ever went <i>without a hand</i>."
    Moreover, Sir ORACLE tells us of its "Great Success;" note the
    capitals, and note also, the expression itself, which was not
    found in the announcement of the repetition of the Second and
    Third Acts of the Light Asian Opera on Monday. Isn't this an
    artful way of pitting Admirable BEMBERG against our own
    accomplished DE-LARA-Boom? "We" were not there either Monday or
    Tuesday, which, as far as the inimitable <i>intermezzo</i> of
    the "Rustic Chivalry" goes, was distinctly "our" loss. But they
    were going to do without us, and they did so; but whether ill
    or well, this deponent, meaning "We," knoweth not; and so,
    we're like Brer Rabbit, who lay low and said nothin'. Brer Wolf

    <h2>THE DUFFER IN POLITICS.</h2>

    <p>My country neighbours at Mount Duffer are not literary. So
    very remote from this condition are they, that they regard men
    of letters as "awful men," in the Shakspearian sense of the
    word. Consequently, since those papers began to appear,
    sometimes, in the pages of <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I have risen in
    the general esteem. Even JOHN DUC MACNAB has been heard to
    admit, that though the MAC DUFFER is "nae gude ava' with the
    rod or the rifle, he's a fell ane with the pen in his hand. Nae
    man kens what he means, he's that deep." In consequence of the
    spread of this flattering belief, I have been approached by
    various local Parties, to sound my fathomless depths as a
    possible Candidate.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:16%;">
        <a href="images/40-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/40-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>First came a deputation of Jacobites. They were all ladies,
    of different ages, young and old; all wore ornaments in which
    the locks of Queen MARY, CHARLES THE FIRST, Prince CHARLIE, and
    other Saints and Martyrs, were conspicuously displayed. Would I
    stand as a Jacobite? they asked, and generally in the interests
    of Romance and Royalism. I said that I would be delighted; but
    inquired as to whether we had not better wait for Female
    Suffrage. That seemed our best chance, I said. They replied,
    that FLORA MACDONALD had no vote, and what was good enough for
    her was good enough for them. I then hinted that it would be
    well to know for which King, or Queen, I was to unfurl the
    banner at Glenfinnon. I also suggested that the modern Crofters
    did not seem likely to rally round us. The first question
    provoked a split, or rather several splits in our Party. It
    appeared that some five or six Pretenders of both sexes, and of
    intricate genealogies, had their advocates. An unpleasant scene
    followed, and things were said which could never be forgiven.
    The deputation, which had been expected to stay to luncheon,
    retired in tears, exclaiming for a variety of monarchs all
    "over the water."</p>

    <p>The local Gladstonians came next. I had never declared
    myself, they said. Was I for Home Rule? I said we must first
    review Mr. GLADSTONE's numerous writings about HOMER, and then
    come to Home Rule. "HOMER stops the way!" Were Mr. GLADSTONES
    Homeric theories compatible with a rational frame of mind? Here
    I felt very strong, and animated with a keen desire to impart
    information. The deputation said all this was ancient history.
    As to Home Rule itself, they said it really did not matter.
    What they wanted was, free poaching, free private
    whiskey-stills, free land, and a large head of game, to be kept
    up by the proprietor, for the benefit of the glen, as in old
    times. I said that these seemed to me to be Utopian demands. If
    you all fish, and shoot, and drown the keepers in the linn, I
    urged, there will soon be no game left for any of you. No
    Game-laws, I observed, and you will obviously have no poaching.
    There will be nothing to poach, and no fun in doing it. They
    said that they would pay keepers to hold the Southern bodies
    off, out of the rates, and the rates would be paid by the
    Laird&mdash;meaning me. I said I knew that several Lairds were
    standing on this platform, but that, personally, if my land and
    rents were to be taken away, I did not see how the rates were
    to be got out of my empty sporran. This was a new idea to them,
    but I cheered them up by saying I was in favour of Compulsory
    Access to Mountains, with no Personal Option in the matter.
    This was what the people needed, I said&mdash;they needed to be
    made to climb mountains, beginning with Box Hill. On Bank
    Holidays, I remarked, they never go to the top. They stay where
    the beer is. I would have a staff of Inspectors, to see that
    they went. The general limbs and lungs would be greatly
    improved, and the sale of whiskey, from private stills, would
    be increased.</p>

    <p>This unlucky remark divided my Party. The Free Kirk Minister
    wore a blue ribbon, and was a Temperance-at-any-price
    politician. Two of "The Men," however,&mdash;a kind of inspired
    Highland prophets&mdash;had a still of their own, and they and
    the Minister nearly came <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> to blows. The Party then
       withdrew, giving three cheers for Mr. GLADSTONE, but not
       pledging themselves to vote for me.</p>

    <p>The Eight Hours' people were at me next. I said I saw that
    the Bill would provide employment for a number of people, but I
    added, that I did not see who was to pay the wages, nor who was
    to buy the goods. For, I remarked, you certainly cannot compete
    with foreign countries at this rate, and at home the Classes
    will be competing with <i>you</i>, being obliged to have
    recourse to manual labour. They said that was just what they
    wanted, everybody to labour with his hands. I answered that
    many of the Classes, a poor lot at best (<i>cheers</i>), would
    come on the Parish. Who was to pay the rates when everybody was
    working, and nobody was buying what was made? If there were no
    markets, where were you to sell your produce? They said they
    would live on the land. I answered that the land would not
    support the population: you would need to import bread-stuffs,
    with what were you going to pay for them? I added that my heart
    was with them, but that they could only attain their ends by
    massacring or starving three-fourths of the population, and who
    knew how he himself might fare, with a three-to-one chance
    against his survival? Suppose it did not come to that, I urged,
    suppose the Bill gave all the world employment; suppose that,
    somehow, it also paid their wages, or supported them, in a very
    short time you would need a Four Hours' Bill (<i>cheers</i>), a
    Two Hours' Bill, a One Hour's Bill, of course with no fall in
    wages. The constitution of things would not run to it.</p>

    <p>They said that I had clearly not fought out the economic
    aspect of the question. I said that was how my hair was
    blanched, with trying to fight it out, but that, somehow, it
    always baffled me. I added remarks about squaring the circle,
    but they said it was a good deal easier to square Mr.
    GLADSTONE. The friends of Total Prohibition of Vaccination and
    of Beer were waiting, also a deputation, who wanted
    subscriptions for a SHELLEY Memorial, Russian Jews, Maxim guns
    for Missionaries, and other benevolent objects. I declined to
    see <i>them</i>, however, and was left to solitude, and to the
    reflection that I am unfitted for the sphere of active
    politics. In this belief the neighbours are now pretty
    generally agreed, which, as I have no keen ambition to shine in
    Parliament, is a very fortunate circumstance.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>The Race for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown was productive of
    tremendous excitement, and everybody turned pale as the two
    gallant horses came up the straight, locked together, but the
    key to the situation&mdash;Parliamentary phrase, due to the
    prevalence of Elections&mdash;was held by the champion
    <i>Orme</i>, who managed to get home, "all out" by a
    neck!&mdash;at least, Lord ARTHUR said he was "<i>all out</i>,"
    though how he could be "<i>home</i>" at the same time I don't
    quite understand&mdash;but he may have been alluding to the
    backers of <i>Orvieto</i>. I was told that <i>St. Damien</i>
    "made up a lot of ground at the finish;" but I can't say I
    noticed it myself, as the course looked to me exactly as it did
    before the race! Dear me! how pleased my friends the Duke and
    Duchess of WESTMINSTER did look! and with good reason,
    too&mdash;it was a wonderful task for <i>Orme</i> to
    accomplish, with only six weeks' training!&mdash;it must have
    been a <i>special</i> train all the time; in fact, the one he
    was brought to Sandown in, I suppose.</p>

    <p>Being unable to go to Leicester, I took advantage of a
    military escort, offered me by&mdash;(no&mdash;let the gallant
    officer's name remain a secret&mdash;he little thought he was
    escorting a Press-lady)&mdash;to pay a visit to the New
    Wimbledon&mdash;and being nothing if not loyal, I chose the day
    when the shooting for the "Queen's" commenced. My escort
    informed me with an inane smile, that the Camp had experienced
    "Bisley weather;" the feebleness of which joke so annoyed me,
    that I am half inclined to put his name in the pillory of
    public print&mdash;(what a glorious expression for our own
    Midlothian Mouther)&mdash;but I refrain, for reasons connected
    with Lord ARTHUR.</p>

    <p>I must say that I think Bisley has a more business-like look
    than Wimbledon ever had, though perhaps this is scarcely to the
    taste of the average feminine visitor, who used to enjoy
    pic-nicing to the accompaniment of whizzing bullets, and does
    not appreciate the latter without the former. The shooting was
    very uncertain in the first stage of the Queen's, as the wind
    was in a variable mood&mdash;(is the wind <i>feminine</i>, I
    wonder?)&mdash;going sometimes at eighteen and sometimes at
    thirty miles an hour, which was disconcerting and inconsiderate
    behaviour (it <i>must</i> be feminine!)&mdash;calculated to
    annoy any right-minded Volunteer! Indeed, one notoriously good
    shot, Private CHICKEN, although a good <i>plucked</i>
    one&mdash;having made six misses in ten shots&mdash;declined to
    be <i>roasted</i> by his friends, and retired into his
    <i>casserole</i>&mdash;which is French for tent, I
    believe&mdash;while several other marksmen (why marksmen?)
    found themselves carefully placing their bullets on other
    people's targets.</p>

    <p>However, I was much struck with the equanimity with which
    reverses were accepted by the members of our gallant Amateur
    Army, and intend composing an ode in their honour, to be sung
    in camp to the accompaniment of bullets, bagpipes, and brass
    bands! (more alliteration for the Midlothian Maltese Marriage

    <p>Certainly, I can foresee my adventures. I can tell of my
    march over the heather, of my delight as the breezy air sweeps
    over the moors, and helps to bronze my already sunburnt
    face!</p>

    <p>I can fancy the chatter of the keeper as he holds my second
    gun, and pays me that attention which can only be wiped off by
    tips! I can hear the sound of the first shot, and decipher the
    meaning of the initial puff of smoke!</p>

    <p>I can see the shadows disappearing as lunchtime comes to
    hand. I can recognise the cart with its goodly contents, and
    the girls who will sit beside us as we discuss our modest pies
    (hot and savoury,) and quaff our '84. And then I can hear the
    retreating footsteps as the darlings trip away, leaving us to
    resume our chase after the birds.</p>

    <p>And then the shadows will grow longer, and the sun will set
    behind the hills in a mass of purple, red, and gold; and it
    will be time for us to turn our faces towards the shooting-box
    that will shelter us through the long watches of the summer's
    night.</p>

    <p>And lastly I can see the final halt at the poulterer's, as
    we purchase the grouse to fill our bags before the journeying
    home.</p>

    <h2>THE NEXT AFRICAN MISSION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Telegraphic Précis of the Negociations.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>First Day.</i>&mdash;Arrived safely at the Sultan's
    capital. Everything in proper order. Draft Treaty in my trunk
    with my diplomatic uniform. Escort in marching order.
    Ammunition in waggon. Quite ready to commence negociations.
    Only waiting for the conjuring paraphernalia of Herr VON
    KLEVERMANN to come up with us. Thought that that special
    morning performance before the King and Queen of the Cannibal
    Islands would delay matters.</p>

    <p><i>Second Day.</i>&mdash;Herr VON KLEVERMANN and his traps
    have arrived in camp. Looked over the conjuring tricks. Sorry
    to find that one of the best (the Inexhaustible Bottle) has
    been stolen by the Queen of the Cannibal Islands. As time is an
    object, unable to send back to recover it. Might have to fight
    for it, too, which would possibly lessen the numbers of our
    escort. Experts declare that the Inexhaustible Bottle could
    only be secured at the point of the bayonet. Have arranged for
    a meeting with the Sultan to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Third Day.</i>&mdash;Sultan's toothache better. His
    Majesty having sent word that he would be glad to see me, I,
    accompanied by the Interpreter, the Commander of the Escort,
    and last, but certainly not least, Herr VON KLEVERMANN, arrived
    at the Palace. Found that the Lord High Chamberlain had been
    removed yesterday. The Lord High Executioner was acting in his
    stead. In fact, this overworked official seemed to be the
    solitary survivor of the Imperial Household. The Lord High
    Executioner told us that His Majesty had been very irritable
    yesterday. The Sultan, he said, was now in a good temper, and
    was quite harmless. I found His Majesty most gracious. However,
    he said that he was not quite prepared to sign a Commercial
    Treaty. He offered, in lieu of signature, to give me twelve
    sacks of emeralds (uncut), and the wives of six of his
    Field-Marshals. Explained that no representative of England
    could entertain such a suggestion. The Sultan, upon this,
    terminated the interview.</p>

    <p><i>Fourth Day.</i>&mdash;The Sultan having learned that Herr
    VON KLEVERMANN was a member of my <i>suite</i>, expressed a
    wish for a second meeting. I consequently attended at the
    Palace. Herr VON KLEVERMANN, having produced a number of
    artificial-flowers, a birdcage, and a rabbit, from an
    Opera-hat, His Majesty asked the price. I immediately replied,
    a Treaty of Commerce. I am to sail again to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Fifth Day.</i>&mdash;Had another interview with His
    Majesty. The Sultan wanted to know the terms of the proposed
    Treaty. I replied, free access to the interior for British
    merchandise, and the abolition of slavery. His Majesty replied,
    he did not mind the abolition of slavery so much, on the
    understanding that the regulation did not apply to him. Herr
    VON KLEVERMANN then produced his Magic hat, and brought out
    from it a cup of coffee, half-a-dozen recently-washed
    handkerchiefs, and a white mouse. The last item caused us to be
    hurriedly expelled from the Palace. It appears that the Sultan
    greatly objects to mice. The Interpreter should have informed
    me of this peculiarity.</p>

    <p><i>Sixth Day.</i>&mdash;Received a message from His Majesty
    to the effect that he would be glad to see me and Herr VON
    KLEVERMANN again, on the condition that nothing objectionable
    should be produced from the Magic hat. Herr VON KLEVERMANN once
    more gave a <i>séance</i>. The eminent entertainer extracted
    from the Gibus a portmanteau, a soup-tureen, and a lady's
    watch. His Majesty greatly delighted. He signed the Treaty, and
    possessed himself of the hat.</p>

    <p><i>Seventh Day.</i>&mdash;Knowing that it was as well to
    leave the country as soon as possible, started early. Herr VON
    KLEVERMANN had expressed his doubts whether His Majesty would
    be satisfied. It appears that the Magic hat requires a good
    deal of preparation to be effective. The Herr's forebodings of
    evil were speedily verified. The Mission had not gone a mile
    before we were followed by the entire army. We made a
    demonstration with the machine-gun, which had the effect of
    destroying six or seven brigades of the enemy. The Sultan in
    person, declared that he considered the Treaty null. Nothing to
    do but retire as best we could.</p>

    <p><i>Eighth Day.</i>&mdash;Deeply regret failure of the
    Mission. However, find that the King and Queen of the Cannibal
    Islands are anxious for annexation to England. They seem
    impressed with the notion that the British Government have
    power to cause a flow of spirits from the Inexhaustible Bottle
    which, since the departure of Herr VON KLEVERMANN, has ceased
    to yield alcoholic drinks. Of course, shall do nothing in this
    new matter until I receive further instructions.</p>

    <p><i>Ninth Day.</i>&mdash;Embarked on my return home.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Ad. Off.</i> Nothing more than the usual

        going to "assume" a number of wounded. To quote from the
        <i>Regulations</i>&mdash;"Before the ships leave for the
        ports, officers in command of fleets and squadrons are to
        communicate to each Commander-in-Chief, by telegraph, the

        reach his port."</p>

        <p><i>Un. Ins.-Gen.</i> Tell me what do we want with these
        pointless Manoeuvres? Wouldn't it have answered everyone's

        Royal United Service Institution?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Ad. Off.</i> I should not be surprised.</p>

        privileged like. I'm <i>canvassing</i>, I am!</p>

        liberty, and, if you have the <i>slightest</i> sense of
        decency&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>imploringly</i>). Now look

        'ear me! If we don't think alike, there's no reason why you
        and me should fall out. I put that to <i>you</i>. It's
        likely enough you don't <i>know</i> JOE QUELCH?</p>

        <p><i>Lady N.</i> (<i>with temper</i>). I never heard of
        the man in my life!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). See there, now.
        That's where canvassing comes in, d'yer see? It's our honly
        way of combating the hignirance and hapathy of the Upper
        Classes. Well, I'll tell yer somethink <i>about</i> 'im.
        QUELCH worked as a lighterman on a barge fourteen years for
        eighteen bob a-week. Ain't <i>that</i> a Man of the People
        for yer? And if he gits into Parliment, he'll insist on
        Labour bein' served fust; he's in favour of Shortened Hours
        of Labour, Taxation o' Ground Rents, One Man one Vote,
        Triannual Parliments and Payment o' Members, Compulsory
        Allotments, Providin' Work by Gov'ment for the Unemployed,
        Abolition o' the 'Ouse o' Lords, and a Free Breakfast
        Table. Ah, and he means <i>'aving</i> it too. That's what
        JOE is. But look 'ere, why not come and 'ear what he's got
        to say for yerself? He's 'oldin' a small open-air meetin'
        in Kipper's Court this evenin', ar-past eight percisely.
        You come and bring yer 'usban', and I'll guarantee you git
        a good place close to the cheer. I'll interdooce yer to him
        arterwards, and he'll answer any questions yer like to arsk
        him&mdash;fair <i>and</i> straight!</p>

        <p><i>Lady N.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). Thank you very much;

        the truth. Carn't trust yerself to listen to both sides.
        But I don't despair of yer yet. See 'ere; is it 'Ome Rule

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>"Read it!" said Everyone. "Read what?" asked the Baron.
    "<i>The Wrecker</i>," answered Everyone. "I will," quoth the
    Baron, promptly. And&mdash;it was done. It took some time to
    do, but of this more anon. The Baron's time is fully occupied,
    never mind how, but fully, take his word for it. A copy of
    <i>The Wrecker</i> was at once provided by its publishers,
    Messrs. CASSELL &amp; Co., and the question for the Baron to
    consider, was not "What will I do with it?" but How, when, and
    where, will I read it? Clearly 'twas no ordinary book.
    Everybody was saying so, and what Everybody is saying has
    considerable weight. A book not to be trained through at
    express pace, so that the beauties of the surrounding scenery
    would be lost, but something that when once taken up cannot be
    put down again, like the brass knobs worked by an
    electric-battery,&mdash;something giving you fits and starts,
    and shocks, as do the electric brass-knobs aforesaid; something
    that, if you begin it at 4 P.M., exhausts you by dinner-time,
    and after dinner, keeps you awake till you read the last line
    at 2 A.M., and then tumble into bed parched, fevered,
    exhausted, but in ecstasies of delight, feeling as if you were
    the hero who had experienced all the dangers, and had come out
    of them triumphantly.</p>

    <p>Such were the Baron's anticipations as to the joys in store
    for him on reading <i>The Wrecker</i>, by Messrs. ROBERT LOUIS
    STEVENSON and LLOYD OSBOURNE. The Baron hit on a plan, he must
    isolate himself as if he were a telephone-wire. "Good," quoth
    he, "Isolation is the sincerest flattery,&mdash;towards
    authors." The friend in need, not in the sense of being out at
    elbows, appeared at the right moment, as did the Slave of the
    Lamp to <i>Aladdin</i>. "Come to my house in the mountains,"
    said this Genius, heartily; "come to the wold where the foxes
    dwell, not a hundred miles from a cab-stand, yet far far
    away,&mdash;amid lovely scenery, in beautiful air, to quiet
    reposeful rooms, with the silence of the cloister and the
    jollity of the Hall where beards wag all, in the evening, when
    the daily task is done." "Friend REGINALD SYDE, I thank thee,"
    responded gratefully the Baron. "I am there!" And in less time
    than it takes to go the whole distance in a four-horsed coach
    with a horn blowing and the horses blown, the Baron, travelling
    by special express, was there,&mdash;all there! The Authorities
    on the line made no extra charge for taking <i>The Wrecker</i>
    as luggage.</p>

    <p>The weather was favourable for reading; an interminable
    downpour, when one is grateful for any book, even a
    <i>Dictionary of Dates</i>, or the remains of a <i>Boyle's
    Court Guide</i>. The Brave Baron shut himself into his room,
    laid in stores of tobacco and grog, decided, in the course of
    half an hour, on a comfortable position, and then laid himself
    out for the perusal, not to say the study, of <i>The
    Wrecker</i>. Introductory Chapter excellent,&mdash;appetising.
    "<i>Oliver</i> asks for more," murmurs the Baron to himself,
    settling down to "the Yarn." Chapter I. Now a strange thing
    happened. The Story broke off! suddenly&mdash;inexplicably.
    Descriptions, yes, by the handful, by the cartload&mdash;all
    excellent, no doubt&mdash;and much to be appreciated by a
    reader with nothing on earth to do the whole year round; but,
    about page 53, the Baron began to be uneasy, shifted his
    pillows, refilled pipe, took "modest quencher," and then turned
    to grapple with <i>The Wrecker</i>. No good. Where the deuce
    had the Story got to? When would the excitement come in? Where
    was the sensation? Toiling on, went the Baron, stopping
    frequently to wish he had a dictionary wherein he might
    ascertain the meaning of strange, uncouth words and phrases,
    and to anathematise the Authors separately or together. Had
    OSBOURNE interfered with STEVENSON, or was STEVENSON allowing
    OSBOURNE to have his say, reserving himself for a grand
    <i>coup</i> at half-price? Would OSBOURNE chuck STEVENSON
    overboard, or was it to be t'other way off? At page 90 the
    Baron decided he would take a walk round, even if it were
    pouring cats and dogs, and exclaiming, "Air, air, give me air!"
    he rushed forth. It was fine. A brisk walk and a
    talk&mdash;just like King CHARLES "who walked and
    talked"&mdash;with his genial host REGI SYDE, restored the
    Baron's circulation, and made him wonder to himself at the
    reported great circulation of the book. Back to his room
    again&mdash;into easy chair&mdash;p. 100&mdash;<i>Happy
    Thought</i>. This book is about ships and sea, The Baron will
    be a Skipper!&mdash;and so he skips, skips, with great relief,
    until "A sail in sight appears,"&mdash;spell it "sale," and
    there's a picture of it&mdash;"He hails it with three
    cheers!"</p>

    <p>Now the Story, at p. 134, begins in good earnest, and,
    except for the idle dilletante reader, all the foregoing, from
    the first Chapter, might go by the board&mdash;that is, as far
    as the Baron can make out. He speaks only for himself. The
    Chapter describing the sale by auction is first-rate; no doubt
    about it. The Baron's spirits, just now down to zero, rose to
    over 100°. On we go: Throw over OSBOURNE, and come along with
    Louis STEVENSON of <i>Treasure Island</i>. Bah! that exciting
    Chapter was but a flash in the pan: brilliant but brief: and
    "Here we are!" growls the Baron, "struggling along among a lot
    of puzzling lumber in search of excitement number two, which
    does not seem to come until Chapter XXIV., p. 383." Then there
    is a good blow out&mdash;of brains, a scrimmaging, a banging,
    and a firing, and a scuffling, and a fainting, and one
    marvellous effect. And then&mdash;is heard no more. The Baron

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
